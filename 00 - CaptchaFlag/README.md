# 00 - CaptchaFlag
## Description
While surfing on one of the Rebel websites he’s already found, R-Boy discovers a new page. It contains three different URLs.

He selects one of the URLs and reaches a web page full of CAPTCHA images.

One of the things R-Boy has learned so far, is that it’s possible to hide a message anywhere.

Can you help R-Boy find the hidden message?

### Run the code
To execute the code it is possible to run the php built-in web server inside this directory (e.g. `php -S localhost:8000`).

## Vulnerability
This is a riddle therefore it does not revolve around any particular vulnerability, the only point I would like to highlight is that if something has to be hidden it should not be exposed.
