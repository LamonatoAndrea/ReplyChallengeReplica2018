## Description
The second URL takes R-Boy to a page showing an apparently-random string. The string has no meaning, but R-Boy wonders if it's another dead endâ€¦or has one of the Rebels put it there for a reason?

Can you help him solve the mystery?

### Run the code
To execute the code it is possible to run the php built-in web server inside this directory (e.g. `php -S localhost:8000`).

## Vulnerability
This challenge does not revolve around any particular vulnerability, but it reinforces to never trust the client system as executing functions that should be performed at a server level allows a malicious user with sufficient knowledge and time to understand and subvert the code itself.
