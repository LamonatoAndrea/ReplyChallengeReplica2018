# Replica of Web Hacking Challenges from Reply in 2018
## tl;dr
Back in 2018, me and some friends took part to the Reply Cyber Security Challenge. Unfortunately we were not able to reach our goal and the last position of the leaderboard was far from us but I got the weird idea to replicate their web challenges so that they can be exploited and studied locally.\

Please be aware that this was a "black box" exercise therefore they are not supposed to be 100% accurate but the aim is to provide the same vulnerability and exploitation methods.\

### Disclaimer
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯` It worked on my machine `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`\
...but I'm open to receive suggestions for improvement.

### Shame on me note
For some reason I do not recall, I used PHP for this project... Probably because it was easy to get vulnerable code with it or because I had too much spare time.

## Web Challenges from Reply in 2018
Below descriptions are based on how challenges have been solved by the team, therefore there may be other solutions / vulnerabilities that I am not aware of.

### 00 - CaptchaFlag
A simple puzzle on HTML source code and base64 encodings.

### 01 - BeautyScript
A challenge about Javascript deobfuscation and cyphering.

### 02 - XMLExternalFlag
A challenge about XXE and command injection vulnerabilities.

### 03 - Secret Keeper
A challenge about hard filtered SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### 04 - Ouch, my backup
A challenge about path traversal vulnerabilities.\
I did not replicated this one, but I do not remember for which reason.\
@Reply: If you ever happen to see this, please give me a sandbox of this challenge so that I can create its replica :)
